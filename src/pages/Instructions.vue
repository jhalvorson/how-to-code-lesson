    <h1>Welcome to coding by numbers</h1>
    <p>The aim of the next 20 minutes is to give you a very light understanding of
     what we do in the frontend of the new website and the ID application.</p>

    <p>Before we dive in, let's go over some of the fundamentals:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>What's a frontend?</strong> A frontend is what you, the user
      interacts with. It's the buttons, the text, the links, anything that you
      are viewing in the browser.</li>
      <li><strong>What's HTML and CSS?</strong> - these are the building blocks of the
      web. HTML is the bricks and CSS is the paint. If you look at the source code for this document
      you'll see that this text is in a &lt;li&gt; tag, which is wrapped in a &lt;ul&gt;
      tag. This indicates that we are in an <strong>unordered list</strong> - this is HTML.</li>
      <li><strong>What's Vue?</strong> - we'll be using a JavaScript language called Vue
      however, don't worry we won't be using that many Vue features, instead we'll
      be working with HTML and CSS concepts.</li>
      <li><strong>What's JavaScript?</strong> - JavaScript is the best programming
      language in the world. JavaScript allows us to render and alter elements in the
      browser (DOM), it can also run on the server meaning you can build entire applications, 
      frontend and backend purely in JavaScript. JavaScript is also to blame for those
      annoying cookie messages and popup adverts. Vue is built with JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>But it looks like the Matrix</strong> - at a quick glance code can seem
      quite complex and that there's no real structure. However, it's like a language, there
      is structure and there's basic building blocks that we start with to help build up
      confidence. And don't worry, we all spend half our day googling stuff as well.</li>
    </ul>
